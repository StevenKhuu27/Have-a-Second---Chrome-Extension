# Have a Second
Have a Second is a chrome extension that is creates a delay before entering time consuming websites. For example, let's say I have been on youtube for too long, by enabling this chrome extension and adding youtube.com to my "naughty" list, there will be a 5 second delay before entering. This allows me to be more mindful of how I am using my time and generally I tend to click off to avoid being disctracted. When I do choose to watch youtube, I am more mindful of how I use my time and take a few seconds for my self.
## Chrome Extension
The chrome extension can be found [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/have-a-second-delayed-gra/ifkcnjjinkfnfmbcpcemnnbbkmobpfcj?hl=en-GB&utm_source=ext_sidebar)
Please feel free to support this project just by using the extension and remaining productive throughout your day, that's all I can ask for :D.
